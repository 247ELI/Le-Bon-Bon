//Peer Review (Brandon Estrada) - Like the theme of choosing the goat LeBron for your story. There is a small issue in page7.html where the beginning of the text starts on the right, the image might be cutting it off or something. It might be because your text isn't in the p tag. Besides that, everything else worked, all images loaded just fine, and all links to pages worked as well.

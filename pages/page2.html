        You start to feel the ice-cold wind blowing through the window that you
        left cracked open. You feel unsettled, looking around for a presence
        that is bothering you. Taking a deep breath, you walk towards your bed,
        seeing your breath floating through the air. You take a seat on the edge
        of your bed, wondering what made you feel this strange. You take a deep
        breath, raising your glass towards your mouth; your lips settle on the
        cup. You take a sip of water. The cup blocks your view, and as you lower
        your cup, you see a figure outside your window staring at you with a
        grin on his face.

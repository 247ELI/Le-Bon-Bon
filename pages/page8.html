    <p>LeBron slowly disappears from the window. You start to get chills, wondering where he went. Then you hear knocking. Terrified, you crawl to the front door and peek through the peephole — his grin has turned into a smile. Still worried, you go back to your room, and all of a sudden, he’s there, smiling menacingly at you. You try to run, but he grabs your shoulder and says, “Wanna play 2K?” So you both sit in the living room and play 2K for the rest of the night like nothing ever happened.

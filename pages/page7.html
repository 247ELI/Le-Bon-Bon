    You run from LeBron in fear, intimidated by his presence. Unphased, he continuously chases you through your house and around the town, where he finally catches you and blows you up before you even realize he caught you (heâ€™s that powerful). In the blink of an eye your entire existence is obliterated and you go into the light without a second thought.

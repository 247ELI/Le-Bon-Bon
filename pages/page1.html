    <p>It's a dark and stormy night. The sound of thunder has kept you up all night. Frightened, you decide to get a warm glass of milk in a last-ditch effort to get some sleep. You rise from you bed walk down the creaky hall. You open your creaky door and shut it close behind you, but feeling a strange presence, a shiver runs down your spine as cold as ice.
